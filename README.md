# Max-Flow

## Implement Ford-Fulkerson method for solving the maximum flow problem
## Implementing necessary code for graph representation without using standard template libraries.

* The running time of the algorithm is O (Ef) where E is the number of edges in the
graph and f is the maximum flow in the graph.
* Using file operations for input and output.
